## Overview

This example shows how it's possible to simulate mouseDown, mouseUp and mousePress on any component based on user keyboard events. This example shows how to create a function which takes a TcHmiButton and keycode and performs all of the housekeeping to enable this.

Please note, this example uses the event.code. Therefore you must use this notation when setting up the script. A list of event.codes can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode).

## Steps to add to your own project

1. Copy & Paste the TcHmiButtonHotkeySetup.js code from the example project to your project.
2. Create a TcHmiButton
3. Open the properties of the TcHmiButton, and select Events
4. Create a new "onAttached" event

5. Drag on the TcHmiButtonHotkeySetup function (found in "Other") and configure with the button and [keycode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode)

6. Test in liveview.

## Code snippet

Below is the extract of TcHmiButtonHotkeySetup.js

```javascript
function TcHmiButtonHotkeySetup(TcHmiButton, KeyCode) {
  const debug = true; // set this to false to stop seeing console.logs.

  if (!TcHmiButton || !KeyCode) return;

  const buttonId = TcHmiButton.getId();
  const button = document.getElementById(buttonId);

  if (!button) {
    console.error(`Button with ID ${buttonId} not found.`);
    return;
  }

  const log = (message) => debug && console.log(message);

  function simulateEvent(eventName) {
    log(`Simulating ${eventName} for ${buttonId}`);
    button.dispatchEvent(
      new MouseEvent(eventName, {
        bubbles: true,
        cancelable: true,
        view: window,
      })
    );
  }

  function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.code === KeyCode) simulateEvent("mousedown");
  }

  function handleKeyUp(event) {
    if (event.code === KeyCode) {
      simulateEvent("mouseup");
      simulateEvent("click");
    }
  }

  log(`Adding keydown and keyup event listeners for ${buttonId}`);
  document.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
  document.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);

  const destroyEvent = TcHmi.EventProvider.register(
    `${buttonId}.onDetached`,
    function (evt) {
      log(`Removing keydown and keyup event listeners for ${buttonId}`);
      document.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
      document.removeEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);
      evt.destroy();
    }
  );
}
```
